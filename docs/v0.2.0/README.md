# dbdict

`dbdict` is a data dictionary tool for DuckDB databases. A `dbdict.yaml` file
describes a database's tables and columns — types, constraints, relationships,
and the domain vocabulary you need to understand them — in a single file that
humans and AI agents can co-author, and the CLI validates that the dictionary
and the real database still agree.

Columns are typed in DuckDB's own type system — `STRUCT`, `ENUM`, `LIST`,
arrays, `DECIMAL(p,s)`, and so on — with a `typedef:` alias layer for naming
and reusing types:

```yaml
$version: "0.2.0"
typedef:
  money: DECIMAL(18, 4)
  address: STRUCT(city VARCHAR, postcode INTEGER)
source:
  duckdb:
    file: warehouse.duckdb
tables:
  - name: trades
    columns:
      - name: qty
        type: BIGINT
      - name: price
        type: money
```

Validation round-trips the dictionary through a scratch in-memory DuckDB and
compares `DESCRIBE` output against the real database, so type checking is
exact — struct fields, enum values, decimal precision, array sizes — with
source-span diagnostics pointing back into the YAML.

Two formats are supported, selected by `$version` (see
[`site/spec.md`](site/spec.md)):

* **`0.2.0` (rich)** — DuckDB-native types + `typedef:`, one dictionary per
  DuckDB database. The current direction.
* **`0.1.0` (legacy)** — the upstream `data-dict.yaml` format (coarse semantic
  types validated against per-table Parquet files), preserved so existing
  files keep validating.

## The CLI

The `dbdict` CLI validates dictionaries at three levels (see
[`site/validation.md`](site/validation.md)) and ships a few helpers:

```
Usage: dbdict <COMMAND>

Commands:
  validate-spec  Validate a dbdict.yaml file or directory against the spec [default: .]
  validate-meta  Validate a dataset's column names and types against a data dictionary
  validate-data  Validate a dataset's values against a data dictionary
  resolve        Print each typedef's canonical DuckDB expansion [default: .]
  ddl            Print executable DuckDB DDL generated from a data dictionary [default: .]
  dummy          Generate a DuckDB database of dummy data from a data dictionary [default: .]
  spec           Print the dbdict.yaml specification
  types parquet  Print column types for a parquet file
  types duckdb   Print every table's column types from a DuckDB database
  skill read     Skill for reading and understanding a data dictionary
  skill write    Skill for creating or updating a data dictionary
  help           Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
```

* `validate-spec` checks that a file is structurally valid and internally
  consistent. Pass a file, or a directory containing a `dbdict.yaml` (falls
  back to the legacy `data-dict.yaml` name; defaults to the current
  directory).
* `validate-meta` compares a dictionary against its database's column names
  and types; `validate-data` also checks values — nulls in `required` columns
  (D01), duplicated `primary_key` values (D02), duplicated values in `unique`
  columns (D03), orphaned `foreign_key` values (D04), and relationship
  `cardinality` violations (D05). The data is located through the
  dictionary's `source`, so only the dictionary is passed.
* `resolve` expands every `typedef:` alias to its canonical DuckDB spelling —
  useful while authoring, and for seeing exactly what validation compares. (A
  legacy dictionary has no typedefs, so it resolves to nothing.)
* `ddl` generates an executable DuckDB script from a rich dictionary —
  `CREATE TYPE` per typedef (in dependency order), then `CREATE TABLE` per
  table — printed to stdout for piping into `duckdb`. The script is proven
  runnable against a scratch in-memory DuckDB before it is printed. Untyped
  columns are omitted; table-scoped typedefs that shadow another typedef's
  name can't be spelled in one flat script, so `ddl` refuses with an error
  naming them. Constraints are deliberately not emitted as
  `PRIMARY KEY`/`NOT NULL`/`UNIQUE` clauses: generated schemas exist mostly
  to be bulk-loaded, and the
  [DuckDB performance guide](https://duckdb.org/docs/current/guides/performance/schema.html)
  advises "For best bulk load performance, avoid primary key constraints".
  Instead, load the data and run `validate-data` — the dictionary's
  constraints are checked by query, after the fact.
* `dummy` generates a DuckDB database of dummy data from a rich dictionary and
  writes it to `--out <file.duckdb>` (required, with no default — so it never
  targets the dictionary's own `source` file by accident). An existing `--out`
  is refused unless `--force`; the write goes through a temp file and a rename,
  so a failed run never destroys an existing database. Values are type- and
  constraint-correct by construction: every generated database passes
  `validate-data` (D01–D05). Use `--rows N` for the global row count
  (default 10), `--rows-table TABLE=N` to override one table, and `--seed N`
  (default 0) for reproducible output. By default about 10% of each optional
  column's values are NULL; set `--null-fraction 0.0` to fill every value (or
  higher, up to `1.0`, for more NULLs). `--sql <file.sql>` also writes the
  generated script for inspection — it leads with a `LOAD` for each declared
  DuckDB extension (it never `INSTALL`s them), so running the file rebuilds the
  same database wherever those extensions are bundled or already installed.
  Values are correct rather than realistic — no names, addresses, or
  distributions. Legacy (0.1.0) dictionaries are refused.
* `types duckdb` / `types parquet` print the column types of a data source.
* `skill read` / `skill write` print embedded agent skills for working with
  data dictionaries, and `spec` prints the full specification.

DuckDB is bundled into the binary (native, in-process): nothing needs to be
installed on `PATH`, and the dictionary's database is always opened read-only.

### Install

Build and install from source with [Cargo](https://rustup.rs):

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/pjc-crates/dbdict dbdict-cli
```

Or clone the repo and build locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pjc-crates/dbdict.git
cd dbdict
cargo build --workspace --release
# binary is at target/release/dbdict
```

The first build compiles the bundled DuckDB (C++), which takes several
minutes; subsequent builds are cached.

## Development

This is a Rust workspace of library crates plus a thin CLI. The core is a pure
library exposing the parsed, resolved dictionary model; the CLI and future
generators (dummy data, SQL/DDL, client codegen) are separate crates that
consume that model:

* `crates/dbdict/` — core: model, source-mapped YAML parsing, validation
  engine, diagnostics. Free of any DuckDB dependency.
* `crates/dbdict-duckdb/` — DuckDB backend (native bundled `duckdb` crate):
  scratch instantiation, schema reading, typedef expansion.
* `crates/dbdict-ddl/` — DDL generator: the first generator crate, consuming
  the lowered model.
* `crates/dbdict-parquet/` — Parquet backend for the legacy format.
* `crates/dbdict-cli/` — thin CLI wrapper (binary: `dbdict`).

```bash
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
```

The website is a [Quarto](https://quarto.org) project in [`site/`](site/),
published to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`.
